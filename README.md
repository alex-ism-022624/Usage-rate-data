# Usage rate of a new launching mobile app (data manipulation required)

Users wanted to know the usage rate of their new launching mobile app. They had data on metabase and google sheet, but they suffered from manually combining data from these two sources. So I wrote a Python scripts on Google Collaboratory to collect, transform and generate final output on a googlesheet as they requested.

## Imported libraries
- pandas
- gspread
- requests
- json

## File description
The file 'python-scripts' contains the script that brings the data in the right shape to be displayed on googlesheet
